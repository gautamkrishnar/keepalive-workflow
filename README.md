# Keepalive Workflow [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/keepalive-workflow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/keepalive-workflow)
GitHub action to prevent GitHub from suspending your cronjob based triggers due to repository inactivity

### Why
GitHub will suspend the scheduled trigger for GitHub action workflows if there is no commit in the repository for the past 60 days. The cron based triggers won't run unless a new commit is made. It shows the message "This scheduled workflow is disabled because there hasn't been activity in this repository for at least 60 days" under the cronjob triggered action.

### What
This workflow will automatically use the GitHub API (or create a dummy commit) in your repo if the last commit in your repo is 50 days (default) ago.
This will keep the cronjob trigger active so that it will run indefinitely without getting suspended by GitHub for inactivity.

## How to use
There are three ways you can consume this library in your GitHub actions

### GitHub API Keepalive Workflow - Default (For GitHub Actions users)
You can just include the library as a step after one of your favorite GitHub actions. Your workflow file should have the checkout action defined in one of your steps since this library needs git CLI to work.
```yaml
name: Github Action with a cronjob trigger
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
permissions:
  actions: write
jobs:
  cronjob-based-github-action:
    name: Cronjob based github action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # - step 2
      # - step n, use it as the last step
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow@v2 # using the workflow with default settings
```

Moving the keepalive workflow into its own distinct job is strongly recommended for better security. For example:
```yaml
name: Github Action with a cronjob trigger
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
jobs:
  main-job:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # - step1
      # - step 2
      # - Step N
  keepalive-job:
    name: Keepalive Workflow
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow@v2
```

### Dummy Commit Keepalive Workflow (For GitHub Actions users)
To use the workflow in auto commit mode you can use the following code, Please note that this will create empty commits in your repository every 50 days to keep it active.
Use the default API based option instead for a clean Git commit history.
```yaml
name: Github Action with a cronjob trigger
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  cronjob-based-github-action:
    name: Cronjob based github action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # - step1
      # - step 2
      # - step n, use it as the last step
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow@v2
        with:
          use_api: true

```

Moving the keepalive workflow into its own distinct job is strongly recommended here as well, for better security:
```yaml
name: Github Action with a cronjob trigger
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
jobs:
  main-job:
    name: Main Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # - step1
      # - step 2
      # - Step N
  keepalive-job:
    name: Keepalive Workflow
    if: ${{ always() }}
    needs: main-job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow@v2
        with:
          use_api: false
```

<details>
  <summary>Let's take an example of [Waka Readme](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme)</summary>

```yaml
name: My awesome readme
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 12 am UTC
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  update-readme:
    name: Update this repo's README
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
        with:
          WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow@v2 # using the workflow
```
</details>

### Using via NPM (For GitHub Actions developers)
For developers creating GitHub actions, you can consume the library in your javascript-based GitHub action by installing it from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keepalive-workflow). Make sure that your GitHub action uses checkout action since this library needs it as a dependency.
You can also ask your users to include it as an additional step as mentioned in the first part.

#### Install the package
Install via NPM:
```bash
npm i keepalive-workflow
```

Install via Yarn:
```bash
yarn add keepalive-workflow
```

#### Use it in your own GitHub action source code
```javascript
const core = require('@actions/core');
const { KeepAliveWorkflow, APIKeepAliveWorkflow } = require('keepalive-workflow');

// Using the lib in Dummy commits mode
KeepAliveWorkflow(githubToken, committerUsername, committerEmail, commitMessage, timeElapsed)
  .then((message) => {
    core.info(message);
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    core.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });

// Using the lib in GitHub API mode
APIKeepAliveWorkflow(githubToken, {
  timeElapsed
}).then((message) => {
    core.info(message);
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    core.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```
